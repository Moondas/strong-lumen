# strong-lumen

Lumen, but with a bunch of security-centric features ðŸ’ª

# Middleware

We added modern security Middleware for Lumen to ensure our APIs are a litte
more hardened than a default install.

The internet is a dangerous place, and non-security minded developers often
make mistakes that could easily be avoided.

## App ID

This is the Identifier someone needs to send through to access your application.

This allows you to add a layer of annoyance to endpoints that do not need authentication,
for example, endpoints that provide certain variables to applications, but that you do
not want to hardcode into your applications.

It's also useful for providing different configuration information from a common
endpoint based on the application in question, useful for things like white labels.

Set `APP_ID` in your .env and wrap your route in the middleware.

Example HTTP Header

```
App: 8A53A5C5-8B3D-4624-ACFA-C14945EC4F88
```

## Registration Access Key

Use this to limit access to registration endpoints to add a layer of annoyance.

This is useful for allowing endpoints for newsletter signups, etc., to know a key
before being able to submit.

Set `REGISTRATION_ACCESS_KEY` in your .env and wrap your route in the middleware.

Example HTTP Header

```
Registration-Access-Key: 8647032F-AFA3-4EB1-ABEA-B0A517394A2B
```

## Throttle

Allows you to set limits per route as to how many requests may happen.

This is useful for mitigating DDoS, Brute Force, and Flooding style attacks.

`'throttle:3,1'` means 3 requests per minute. `'throttle:300,1'` means 300.

Certain common routes have default throttles.

Responds with headers indicating how many requests are left on these routes,
and information about when bans expire.

Before Limit:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 5
```

After Limit you get a `429 Too Many Requests`, and the Response Body contains

```
Too many consecutive attempts. Try again in 5s
```

## Common Security Headers

Includes a set of Common security headers for browsers that support them.

Useful for defense against many different types of common attacks.

The aim is to support the [OWASP Secure Headers Project Specification](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Headers_Project)

### Content Security Policy

A good Content Security Policy helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

Content Security Policy (CSP) requires careful tuning and precise definition of the policy. If enabled, CSP has significant impact on the way the browser renders pages (e.g., inline JavaScript disabled by default and must be explicitly allowed in policy). CSP prevents a wide range of attacks, including Cross-site scripting and other cross-site injections.

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none', connect-src 'self', 'upgrade-insecure-requests';
```

### X-Content-Type-Options

Setting this header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as something else than declared by the content type in the HTTP headers.

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

### X-Frame-Options

X-Frame-Options response header improve the protection of web applications against Clickjacking. It declares a policy communicated from a host to the client browser on whether the browser must not display the transmitted content in frames of other web pages.

```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

### X-XSS-Protection

This header enables the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter in your browser.

```
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol.

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=7776000; includeSubDomains
```

## No Cache Headers

Disables caching

```
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate
```

## Server Header

Adds information about the server.

Useful for overriding and obscuring the name of the technology running
the web server, e.g. making Apache look like nginx, or for announcing
the application name and version.

```
Server: APP_NAME (APP_VERSION)
X-Powered-By: APP_NAME (APP_VERSION)
```

Requires APP_NAME and APP_VERSION set in the .env file.

## CORS

Adds support for Cross Origin Resource Sharing.

See `config/cors.php` for all options.

Defaults to:

```
'supportsCredentials' => true,
'allowedOrigins' => ['*'],
'allowedHeaders' => ['Content-Type', 'Content-Length', 'Origin', 'X-Requested-With', 'Debug-Token', 'Registration-Access-Key', 'X-CSRF-Token', 'App', 'User-Agent', 'Authorization'],
'allowedMethods' => ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT',  'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
'exposedHeaders' => ['Authorization'],
'maxAge' => 0,
```

Should support OPTIONS Preflight with Authorization header.

# JWT

You should use a 512 bit, asymmetrical algo, with certificates.

It is suggested that you use `ES512`, or the `RS512` algo if you are unable to use `ES512`.

You can make a `ECDSA 512 (ES512)` pair like this:

```bash
# DO NOT EVER COMMIT THE PRIVATE KEY
# Make private key
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp521r1 -noout -out ecdsa-p521-private.pem
# Make the corresponding public key
openssl ec -in ecdsa-p521-private.pem -pubout -out ecdsa-p521-public.pem
```

You can make a `RSA 512 (RS512)` pair like this:

```bash
# DO NOT EVER COMMIT THE PRIVATE KEY
# Make private key
openssl genrsa -out rsa512-private.pem 4096
# Make the corresponding public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in rsa512-private.pem -out rsa512-public.pem
```

Make sure you set the appropriate variables in your .env

You may use a symmetrical algo, but then you'll be relying on a secret instead of a keypair. This is not recommended.

Token is blacklisted on logout.

# Roles

There is support for user roles. Specify for a route using:
```
middleware => ['roles:user,admin']
```
Or for a user to have any role to access a route
```
middleware => ['roles']
```

## Role endpoints
`roleId` refers to the UUID of the role, accessible through `GET` `/roles`
- `GET` `/roles/{roleId}/users`
- `GET` `/roles/{roleId}`
- `GET` `/roles/`
- `POST` `/roles/{name}`
- `DELETE` `/roles/{roleId}`
- `POST` `/roles/{roleId}/activate`
- `POST` `/roles/{roleId}/deactivate`

## Assigning roles to users
- `GET` `/users/{id}/roles`
- `POST` `/users/{id}/roles/assign/{roleId}`
- `POST` `/users/{id}/roles/revoke/{roleId}`

In order to manage roles your user must have the admin role assigned.

# UUIDs

It is suggested to use UUIDs in your responses instead of IDs, which are
generally enumerable.

This will help mitigate some forms of enumeration attacks.

It is suggested that you use UUID version 4, which is random.

```php
use Webpatser\Uuid\Uuid;
UUID::generate(4);
```

# User Registration

There is augmented functionality with the user models and registrations.

An `_id` field has been added which should be used to obscure the internal
id.

You should use a UUID to protect against various attacks.

Required fields are `username`, `password`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`.

Additionally, users are assigned an `_id` and an `api_key` when getting created.

Confirmation codes are sent out via email

See the RegistrationController for full details.

# Soft Deletes

Soft Deletes are enabled by default.

This is important for logging, compliance, and forensics should a destructive
action be entered into the system.

# Additional Audit Fields

In addition to the usual `created_at` and `deleted_at` that come with timestamps,
we've added some additional fields to help your API be more compliant.

* `created_by`
* `deleted_by`
* `updated_by`
* `updated_at`

# System User

There is a System User that must be seeded. This user is designed to be
unusable, and should be used to indicate that the system has performed an
action.

Set the appropriate `created_by` and `updated_by` type fields when
performing changes in the system using the system user.

You must set `SYSTEM_USER_ID` and `SYSTEM_USER_EMAIL` in your .env

# Migration

There is a single migration that will setup the base user table and a
password reset table.

`php artisan migrate`

# Seed

There will be a system user added during this process.

There will be 3 roles added - user, admin, and system.

`php artisan db:seed`

# Tests

Run

`./vendor/bin/phpunit`

View the coverage in `/tests/coverage`

# Travis

You need to enable CodeCov and include your token as CODECOV_TOKEN _within_ Travis.

Set an environment variable in Travis for this.

Travis also requires additional environment variables if you want to auto deploy.

# Emails

There are 2 included emailers that form part of the registration and
verification processes.

* Confirm Account
* Password Reset

# Additional Packages

These are the additional support packages in this project

* tymon/jwt-auth - Provides JWT Functionality
